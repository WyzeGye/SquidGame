A self tuning motorcycle ECM project
The goal is to be optimized for plug and play performance. Starting with support for up to 4 cylinders, and any sensors you can throw at it. 
Dyno support is included.

From installation to a fully self-tuned, high resolution, Fuel Map will take about 90 hours of riding with current parameters, this can be cut down to about 8 hours on a dyno.
